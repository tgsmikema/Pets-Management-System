# Images

This folder contains all the images for your reports (both proposal and final report.)

The only required image is ecse-decal-title.png. If you delete this file your reports will **NOT** build.

This folder also contains some SPCA logos that can be used in your reports and application if desired. We have permission to use these logos but they must **NOT** be shared in the public domain.
