# Mobile

## Project structure

screen/: this folder store all the UI stuff, such as the Activity and Fragment

model/: this folder store the model class, such as user, dog etc.

service/: this folder is used for the web API service

util/: this folder is used for some util class

## Design pattern and technology used

For the android project, the MVP design pattern will be applied to the project. For the UI element access in activity or fragment we will use viewBinding rather than findViewById method. For the other technology, it will be added later.
