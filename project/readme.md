# Project folder

Use this folder to store all code and other artifacts for your project.

You should divide this folder into sub-folders to store the specific components of your project. A suggested structure is:

- hardware
- embedded
- backend
- frontend 1 *(use the actual frontend type, eg mobile, desktop, web)*
- frontend 2
- media

However, you can organise this folder anyway that your team decides.
