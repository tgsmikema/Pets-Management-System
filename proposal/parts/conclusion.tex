\chapter{Conclusion}

This project is a development to help the SPCA in caring for their animals through automating weighings. This will help to get more accurate weights, reduce the need for re-weighings, and streamline the weight recording process. 

We will build a digital scale to measure these weights, which will send the measurement data through embedded software to the software backend. This measurement will be stored in a database, and exposed to the user through two front-ends: a mobile app and a web app. 

Staff at the SPCA will use the product by navigating the software to find a dog, and add a weight. They will then place the dog on the scales and the weight will be sent through the embedded software and automatically added to the software. The software will support additional functionalities including viewing statistics and trends, and managing their account. 

This product will help the SPCA to be more efficient, reduce the stress on their animals, and allow staff to better care for their animalsâ€™ health.
