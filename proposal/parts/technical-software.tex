\chapter{Software Components}

The software requirements of this project include an embedded software component, a backend and two frontend components. The embedded system will communicate with the digital scale and the software backend. The backend will store data and communicate with the frontends, which will display the information to SPCA staff and allow them to enter weights. 

This section will review some of the existing products, and will then specify our design of the various software components.
